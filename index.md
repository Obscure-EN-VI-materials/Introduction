### FAQ
**Q:** Why do you share the materials?

**A:** ~~Why not...~~ As a student at a certain English "club", I would constantly find myself searching for almost every question online. I have developed this habit since 9th grade or so I thought. Yet, I'm still one of the best students in English at that school!

The materials that can't be searchable is not *really* my problem, though. I can still use my brain to complete the questions myself. Still, I can't really answer all of them correctly. Our lecturer will then give me the correct answer, and I will just move on. Back then, I wouldn't care what to do next, because I was too busy doing practice tests over and over.

Fast forward to 2023, I started to care about the others. What about those who are also lazy like me and is frustrated when the answers cannot be found online? After all, the Internet have helped me a lot since I took up English as my favorite subject. Perhaps I can contribute what I have had in hand and make the Internet somewhat a better place.

So, if that didn't answer the initial question, that's the reason why I'm starting to share the materials, preferably English. Sharing is caring, and copying is an act of love. I collected what is currently missing, so it's time to pay back to the community! I try my best to keep them up-to-date, and even allowed submission to other people who want to contribute. Something as simple as starring my repository and sharing to other people can also help me a lot. Don't be an ego, it won't pay back!

TL;DR: I want to share what the Internet haven't shared yet.

**Q:** Why another website? Why don't you just submit them to the existing ones?

**A:** The truth is, if I submit to other sites, I doubt they will care at all. They are either too busy making online courses for students, or they will just ignore my submissions as a whole.

These sites are also really heavy, though. Did you know that [the average size of a webpage is now the size of Doom](https://www.wired.com/2016/04/average-webpage-now-size-original-doom/)? My website is here to fix that, almost all webpages here are under 100KB, and with cached resources, can be as small as 10KB! Don't forget that my site is also ad-block friendly (curse you cungthi.online and your BlockAdBlock!) and doesn't require JavaScript (okay, there's anchor.js, but you can still use the website without JS enabled).
